There are X steps to autogenerated the code to invoke the remote methods we have extracted.

1. Create a generic single-view Xcode application for iOS that uses Objective-C

2. run the map\_potential\_methods\_to\_mach-ports.py script to generate invocation code and overwrite your app's ViewController.m file.
`python map_potential_methods_to_mach-ports.py > ~/Desktop/test_autoCoder/test_autoCoder/ViewController.m`

3. run the auto\_generate\_header.py script to generate headers for the invocations and create a .h file in your app called fake\_header.h
Within Xcode, you may need to 'add' the header file to the app, so that the app will recognize that the file can be imported.
In the left window of Xcode, there should be a list of files.
Right-click the app's directory and click "Add Files to ..."
`python auto_generate_header.py > ~/Desktop/test_autoCoder/test_autoCoder/fake_header.h`

4. Modify Xcode's header files to allow initWithMachServiceName if you haven't already.

5. Compile and run the app on a real iOS device. The simulator shouldn't work.

6. copy and paste the output of Xcode into a file at the following path
`iOracle/kobold/map_methods_to_mach_ports/input_data/xcode_results.txt`

7. run parseXcodeLogs.py to parse through the results and focus on those invocations that successfully triggered completion handlers.
